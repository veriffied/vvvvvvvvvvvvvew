    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-green-700">About Green Media</h2>
    <p class="text-sm text-gray-800 mb-4">
      At <span class="font-semibold text-green-700">Green Media</span>, we believe in the transformative power of storytelling—and that Africa is the next frontier of global cinema. With over 65% of its population under the age of 45, the African continent is rich with youthful energy, untapped talent, and countless stories waiting to be told. It is a region brimming with creativity, resilience, and the potential to shape the future of the global film and entertainment industry.
    </p>
    <p class="text-sm text-gray-800 mb-4">
      Recognizing this opportunity, Green Media was founded through a strategic partnership between local visionaries and international collaborators. Our mission is twofold: to empower Africa’s next generation of filmmakers, and to bridge the gap between the African market and the global entertainment community. We envision a vibrant creative ecosystem that not only celebrates African narratives but also contributes meaningfully to economic growth—projected to generate over 20 million jobs and add $20 billion to the continent’s GDP.
    </p>
    <p class="text-sm text-gray-800 mb-4">
      But Green Media is more than a platform—it is a movement. Drawing inspiration from the principles of green screen technology, we embrace innovation, sustainability, and inclusivity. We are committed to eco-friendly, cost-effective, and time-efficient production methods that are aligned with environmental and social responsibility. This is what we define as <span class="italic text-green-700 font-medium">"Green Media"</span>—a modern, ethical approach to entertainment that respects both people and planet.
    </p>
    <p class="text-sm text-gray-800 mb-4">
      By fostering cross-cultural collaboration, facilitating industry access, and championing authentic African voices, we aim to reshape the global media landscape. Our work serves as a gateway for international production companies to understand and engage with African audiences, while providing local creatives the tools and exposure they need to thrive on a global stage.
    </p>
    <p class="text-sm text-gray-800 font-semibold">
      At Green Media, we don’t just create content—we cultivate opportunity, empower storytellers, and build sustainable bridges between Africa and the world.
